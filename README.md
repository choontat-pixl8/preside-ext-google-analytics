# Google Analytics for Preside

This extension allows you to easily insert Google Analytics "tags" into your Preside website's pages.

## Installation

From a commandline at the root of your application: 

```
box install preside-ext-google-analytics
```

## Configuration

Once installed, login to the Preside admin and head to **System -> Settings -> Google Analytics** and enter your analytics credentials.

## Usage

The extension will take care of inserting analytics "tags" into your layout automatically for you, you won't need to do anything else.

## Contributing and roadmap

Pull requests, issues and ideas are all welcome :) Please use Github or get in touch with the Preside team on our [Preside Slack](https://presidecms-slack.herokuapp.com/).

We could obviously do a lot more with this extension and would be great to collaborate with anyone who has ideas!
